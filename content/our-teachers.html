The Youth Program is being conducted by the following teachers:

<h2>Mawlana Asif Uddin</h2>
<p>
Asif Uddin began his quest for knowledge at a very young age. Asif completed his memorization of The Qur'an at the age of 15 at the Institute of Islamic Education in Elgin, Illinois (IIE). Soon thereafter, he began the 'alimmiyah program at IIE which he completed in 2012 at the age of 21. Sciences which he studied included, but are not limited to, Arabic grammar, morphology, rhetoric, jurisprudence, Quranic exegesis, hadith, and ‘aqidah. Also, he has taught various summer Arabic programs and served as a part-time instructor for Quranic memorization (hifdh). Currently, he is a full-time student at Benedictine University pursuing an undergraduate degree in Elementary Education. In addition, Asif’s thirst for more Islamic knowledge continues at Darul Qasim where he is currently pursuing a post-graduate degree. Along with his studies, Asif teaches a part-time Islamic Studies class specifically geared for the youth and their struggles. In his free time, Asif likes to cross opponents up in basketball.

<h2>Farhan Ahmed</h2>
